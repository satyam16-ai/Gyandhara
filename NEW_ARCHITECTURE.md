# VoiceBoard Educational Platform - New Architecture

## 🏗️ Complete System Redesign

### Architecture Overview
The system has been completely redesigned with a **Classroom → Lecture → Student Joining → Whiteboard Broadcasting** workflow:

```
Teacher Creates Classroom → Creates Lectures in Classroom → Students Join Classroom → 
Students Access Scheduled Lectures → Teacher Starts Lecture → Real-time Whiteboard Broadcasting
```

## 🔑 Key Components

### 1. **Authentication System**
- **Separate Login Pages**: `/teacher-login` and `/student-login`
- **Role-based Validation**: Backend validates user roles and redirects appropriately
- **JWT Tokens**: Secure authentication with role-specific access

### 2. **Teacher Workflow**
1. **Login** → Teacher Dashboard (`/teacher-dashboard`)
2. **Create Classroom** → Get unique 6-digit classroom code (e.g., `ABC123`)
3. **Create Lectures** → Schedule lectures within the classroom
4. **Start Lecture** → Begin live whiteboard session
5. **Broadcast Content** → Real-time whiteboard data to all students

### 3. **Student Workflow** 
1. **Login** → Student Dashboard (`/student-dashboard`)
2. **Join Classroom** → Enter teacher's classroom code
3. **View Lectures** → See scheduled and live lectures in enrolled classrooms
4. **Join Live Lecture** → Access teacher's whiteboard in real-time
5. **Participate** → Receive whiteboard updates, chat, raise hands

## 📊 Database Architecture

### New Models Added:

#### **Classroom Model**
```javascript
{
  classroomCode: String (unique, 6-digit, e.g., "ABC123"),
  name: String,
  subject: String,
  description: String,
  teacherId: ObjectId,
  teacherName: String,
  enrolledStudents: [{
    userId: ObjectId,
    studentName: String,
    enrolledAt: Date,
    status: 'active' | 'inactive' | 'removed'
  }],
  settings: {
    allowSelfEnrollment: Boolean,
    requireApproval: Boolean,
    maxStudents: Number,
    isArchived: Boolean
  },
  stats: {
    totalLectures: Number,
    totalStudents: Number,
    totalHours: Number,
    averageAttendance: Number
  }
}
```

#### **StudentEnrollment Model**
```javascript
{
  studentId: ObjectId,
  classroomId: ObjectId,
  classroomCode: String,
  enrolledAt: Date,
  status: 'pending' | 'active' | 'inactive' | 'removed',
  attendanceStats: {
    totalLecturesAttended: Number,
    totalLecturesScheduled: Number,
    attendancePercentage: Number,
    lastAttended: Date
  }
}
```

#### **Enhanced RoomClass Model** (Lectures)
```javascript
{
  // Existing fields...
  classroomId: ObjectId,           // Links to parent classroom
  classroomCode: String,           // For quick reference
  lectureNumber: Number,           // Auto-incrementing within classroom
  roomId: String,                  // Generated as "CLASSCODE-L1", "CLASSCODE-L2", etc.
}
```

## 🌐 API Endpoints

### Classroom Management
- `POST /api/classrooms/create` - Create new classroom
- `GET /api/classrooms/teacher/:teacherId` - Get teacher's classrooms
- `POST /api/classrooms/join` - Student joins classroom with code
- `GET /api/classrooms/student/:studentId` - Get student's enrolled classrooms
- `GET /api/classrooms/:classroomId/details` - Get classroom details with lectures

### Lecture Management
- `POST /api/classrooms/:classroomId/lectures` - Create lecture in classroom
- `GET /api/classrooms/:classroomId/lectures` - Get lectures for classroom
- `POST /api/room-classes/:lectureId/start` - Start lecture (makes it live)
- `POST /api/room-classes/:lectureId/end` - End lecture

## 🎨 Frontend Components

### New Dashboard Components
- `NewTeacherDashboard` - Complete classroom and lecture management
- `NewStudentDashboard` - Classroom enrollment and lecture access
- Both dashboards have tabbed interfaces with overview, detailed views, and statistics

### Features Implemented
- **Classroom Creation**: Teachers can create classrooms with auto-generated codes
- **Student Enrollment**: Students join using classroom codes
- **Lecture Scheduling**: Teachers create lectures within classrooms
- **Live Broadcasting**: Real-time whiteboard synchronization when lectures are active
- **Attendance Tracking**: Automatic attendance recording and statistics
- **Role-based UI**: Different interfaces and capabilities for teachers vs students

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Start the System
```bash
./restart-system.sh
```

### 2. Access the Platform
- **Teacher Portal**: http://localhost:3000/teacher-login
- **Student Portal**: http://localhost:3000/student-login
- **Admin Panel**: http://localhost:3000/admin-login

### 3. Test Credentials
- **Teacher**: `username=teacher, password=teacher123`
- **Student**: `username=student, password=student123`
- **Admin**: `username=admin, password=admin123`

## 🔄 Complete Workflow Example

### Teacher Side:
1. Login → Teacher Dashboard
2. Click "New Classroom" → Create "Physics 101" → Get code "PHY101"
3. Share code "PHY101" with students
4. Click "Add Lecture" → Schedule "Newton's Laws" for tomorrow 2 PM
5. When time comes → Click "Start Lecture" → Opens whiteboard
6. Draw/teach on whiteboard → Content broadcasts to all students in real-time

### Student Side:
1. Login → Student Dashboard  
2. Click "Join Class" → Enter code "PHY101" → Successfully enrolled
3. See "Physics 101" classroom → View scheduled lectures
4. When teacher starts → See "🔴 Newton's Laws - LIVE NOW" 
5. Click "Join Now" → Access teacher's whiteboard in real-time
6. See everything teacher draws/writes automatically

## 📈 Benefits of New Architecture

1. **Organized Structure**: Classrooms contain multiple lectures vs old single-room approach
2. **Persistent Enrollment**: Students stay enrolled in classrooms across multiple lectures  
3. **Better Tracking**: Comprehensive attendance and engagement statistics
4. **Scalable**: Teachers can manage multiple classrooms, students can join multiple classrooms
5. **Professional UI**: Modern, intuitive interfaces for both teachers and students
6. **Real-time Sync**: Improved whiteboard broadcasting with lecture-specific sessions
